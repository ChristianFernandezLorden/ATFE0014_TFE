I wish to express my gratitude to each and every person who helped me in some way or another to write this thesis.

First and foremost, I would like to thank my two supervisors, without whom I would not have managed to undertake this journey.
Pierre Sacr√©, whose supervision, counsel, and insight during our meetings helped me build and structure my thesis.
Guillaume Drion and his profound knowledge of systems and neurons, who helped me grasp many concepts that were foreign to me.

Similarly, I would like to express my appreciation to Alessio Franci. Despite not being my official supervisor, he attended nearly all of my meetings and took the time to guide me through the field of neuromorphic engineering. I would also like to thank him for his neuronal models, which form the basis of this thesis.

Finally, I want to thank my family and friends. Without their unwavering support, I would never have been able to find the strength to achieve this work.
